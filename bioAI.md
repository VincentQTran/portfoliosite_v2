# Engineering biology with AI

In my PhD, I am focused on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to refine the engineering of gene editing tools, specifically mobile genetic elements. This involves applying novel AI tools that can design, optimize, and predict the outcomes of MGE-based genetic modifications with enhanced precision and efficiency. By integrating AI into genetic engineering, my aim is to develop a new suite of MGE tools that are more effective for various organisms and uses.

## Previous Experience

* Studied kinase receptor trafficking in the Schepartz Lab.
* Started my PhD in the [Yale BBS Program](https://medicine.yale.edu/bbs/).
* Graduated with a B.Sc degree in Biochemistry from UCLA.
* Investigated HIV-1 drug resistance in the Chow Lab.
